# Campaign Dashboard notes

## IRS Dashboard, brainstorming ideas

1. **Overall Campaign Progress:**

   - **Total Villages Covered vs. Planned:** Display the number of villages where spraying has been completed versus the total planned.
   - **Total Houses Sprayed vs. Planned:** Show the number of houses sprayed to date compared to the planned number.
   - **Coverage Rate:** Percentage of houses sprayed out of the total planned.
   - **Insecticide Utilization:** Track the amount of insecticide used versus the planned amount, based on area/room metrics.
   - **Refusal Rate:** Percentage of houses that refused spraying.
   - Heatmap of high/low coverage or refusal rates across locations
   - **Flags any emerging issues like high refusal rates or insecticide shortages.**

2. **Operational efficiency:**

   - **Average houses sprayed per day per team:** Track the speed and efficiency of each team.
   - **Time taken to complete each location:** Identify locations that take longer and investigate potential reasons.
   - **Unsprayed locations:** Analyze the reasons for not spraying locations (refusal, closed houses, etc.).
   - **Allows for comparisons and identification of best practices**

3. **Daily Progress Tracking:**

   - **Daily Targets vs. Achieved:** Graphical representation (e.g., line or bar chart) showing daily goals versus actual accomplishments to track the pace of the campaign.
   - **Coverage Rate:** Percentage of households visited versus those planned for each day/week.

4. **Data quality and completeness:**
   - Data consistency: Check for inconsistencies and errors in reported data (e.g., population exceeding house capacity).
   - **Number of missing reports:**
   - **Timeliness of report submission:** Track the average time taken for teams to submit reports after each spraying day.

5. **Additional Considerations:**

   - **Filter and drill down:** Allow users to filter data by team, location, day, and other relevant criteria.
   - **Compare with historical data:** If available, compare campaign performance with previous campaigns to identify trends and improvements.

6. **Report Generation:**

- I can help you generate reports that summarize campaign performance, identify areas for improvement, and support data-driven decision-making. These reports could include:
  - **Campaign summaries:** Completion rates, insecticide usage, population covered.
  - **Team performance reports:** Houses sprayed, insecticide used, reasons for non-spraying.
  - **Regional analysis:** Coverage achieved, challenges faced in different regions.
