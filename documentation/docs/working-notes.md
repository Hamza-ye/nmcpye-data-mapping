# Working Notes

This page contains my working random notes for this project. Here, I'll jot down my thoughts, ideas, and progress during working with the data. These notes are random a work in progress and may not be fully accurate or complete and might be wrong, or there might be better way _-please, suggest_, I usually work with software not with such data, and I am learning as I go. However, these notes my provide insight into my approach and may be helpful to others working with the final data to approach any issue that may arise.
