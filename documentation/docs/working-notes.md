# Working Notes

Welcome to my working notes! This page is where I'll be jotting down my random thoughts, ideas, and assumptions around the data as I progress through this project. It's also where I'll document my progress and make updates as I go along. Please keep in mind that these notes may not be fully accurate or complete, as they reflect my thought process and work in progress. However, I hope they'll provide some insight into my approaches while working with this data, and may even help others who work with the final data to approach any issues that may arise.
