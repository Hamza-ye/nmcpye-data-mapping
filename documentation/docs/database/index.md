## IRS Database structure documenting

The provided SQL schema outlines a database structure designed to support the management and tracking of National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) campaigns such as ITNs, IRS, AMD and other. Here's a detailed description of the database schema based on the revised comments:

### Overview

The schema is organized to facilitate the planning, execution, and reporting of malaria control campaigns. It encompasses various aspects of these campaigns, including:

### Key Components

1. **Campaign Information (`m_campaign`):** This table is central to the schema, categorizing each campaign by type (e.g., IRS or ITNs), year, and other identifying details. It enables the tracking of multiple, simultaneous campaigns.

2. **Locations (`m_villages_locations`):** A comprehensive list of all potential target locations within the country, which can be selected during campaign planning. This table serves as a reference for planning and reporting, without being directly tied to a specific campaign.

3. **Regions (`c_region`):** Specifically for IRS campaigns, regions are defined to streamline planning and resource allocation. Each region can encompass multiple locations and is associated with a specific campaign.

4. **Warehouses/Distribution Points (`c_warehouses_distribution_points`):** Identified locations where campaign materials (pesticides for IRS or nets for ITNs) are stored and from where they are distributed to operational teams. These points are crucial for logistical planning.

5. **Teams (`c_team`):** Details about the teams conducting the spraying or net distribution, including the differentiation between foremen (team leaders) and supervisors for reporting and operational clarity.

6. **Targets (`c_targets_master`):** Planned locations that will be targeted in a certain campaign are stored in this table detailing which the Regions and Wh/distribution points withing each region.

7. **Daily Targets (`c_daily_targets`):** Operational plans detailing which teams are assigned to which targeted-location on specific days, including estimates of population, housing, and the resources required to achieve campaign goals.

8. **Data Collection and Reporting (`c_kobo_irs_team_main`):** Captures detailed reports from the field, including outcomes of daily operations, reasons for any deviations from the plan, and GPS data for verification purposes.

### Purpose and Utility

This schema is designed to support comprehensive tracking and management of NMCP campaigns, facilitating data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency. By structuring data around campaigns, locations, teams, and logistics, the schema provides a solid foundation for monitoring progress, evaluating impact, and planning future campaigns. It allows for detailed reporting and analysis, which are crucial for adjusting strategies, ensuring resource availability, and achieving the overall goal of malaria control and eradication.

### Operational planning

A campaign starts in `campaign_start_date` and takes specified `campaign_days`, Consecutive.

**In planning phase before the campaign:**

- Campaign Start date is determined.
- Locations that will be targeted and sprayed are Specified from `m_villages_locations`.
- Targeted locations are divided and grouped as multiple Regions and within each region into one or more WH-distribution-Point and this info is placed in `c_targets_masters` table.
- the number of required teams are determined and the daily operational plan is planned and `c_daily_targets` table is populated.

**Important variables set during planning:**

- `c_daily_targets.target_houses`: locations total Houses.
- `c_daily_targets.target_room_per_house`: Estimated AVG Rooms per house.
- `c_daily_targets.target_room_avg_area`: a Room Estimated AVG Area.
- `c_daily_targets.target_daily_area_coverage_rate`: Estimated Daily Area coverage Rate per worker.
- `m_campaign.campaign_days`: the Campaignâ€™s number of days `IRS usually planned = 11 days, and ITNs = 6 days`.
- `c_daily_targets.target_area_per_sachet`: Estimated Area Covered per sachet of pesticide is Known `usually = 250`.
- `c_team.team_no_of_team_workers`: number of team's spraying workers.

In the daily Operational plan table A team will cover multiple locations for N-days

**Important calculations:**

- **Estimated Rooms Target** = c_daily_targets.target_houses x c_daily_targets.target_houses.
- **Estimated Area Target** = Estimated Rooms Target x c_daily_targets.target_room_avg_area.
- **Estimated Pesticide sachets Required** = Estimated Area Target / c_daily_targets.target_area_per_sachet.
- Estimated daily area coverage rate per worker = c_kobo_irs_team_main.report_rooms_sprayed_entered x c_daily_targets.target_room_avg_area

**Important meanings and terminology for progress_status:**

When Estimating futures of any thing progress_status is usually need to be taken into account:

- for `progress_status` in  of each sent report:
  - `full`: activity completed in this target with full coverage.
  - `partial`: activity completed in this target with partial coverage.
  - `ongoing`: activity still not completed yet.
  - `NotTargeted, the reason`: activity still not completed yet.

### The Database tables SQL creation

```sql

-- `m_campaign`: Stores information about each campaign. It supports multiple types of campaigns (e.g., ITNs with `campaign_type_id`=1, IRS with `campaign_type_id`=2), allowing the database to track various intervention strategies.
